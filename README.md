# Retrofit 2.0
Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.

In the project i have used retrofit and Gson for connecting to the api of the system and the json data sent from the api are converted using Gson and the gson converted data are used in the application. In project has used retrofit enque and execute both functions as per needed for the system to function properly.

# Conclustion
E-voting system will manage the Voterâ€™s information by which voter will be able to login to the system via their phone and use their voting right to vote for the candidates that they want to see winning. It relegates and makes it easy in voting where everything is taken care via machines making it automated and accurate. Database is created where huge amount of data can be inserted and can be processed without having any issues.
As voting has to be accurate and secured the online voting application will help in making the voting more easy security as the mobile is only assessable to the user of the phone where he has the security parts installed and used. The use of voting system application will ultimately decrease the processing and voting time as it used to take and make it more secured and automated.
